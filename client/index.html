      <h2>One of my best friends</h2>

      <p>
        My cat <strong>Murko</strong>, was the best cat in the world. Ever since he was little he was always a curious cat. He always wanted to play and enjoy hanging out. He would listen to me about my thoughts and try to cheer me up when I was down. Coming in for cat hugs and just sleeping with me when we both tired. There would be times when we may forget to feed him but he knew he we were just trying to get him to eat less.

      <p>
        There would be times where he would meow, im sure it was cause he was lonely or he thought he was alone. Everytime he would do that, I would make sure he is not and let him know everything is okay. I feel like he would know when I would be having a bad day cause when I would get home he would come into my room, <em>yes even though he would go to sleep</em>, he made me feel not alone and eventually I would take a nap next to him.
