      <h2>One of my best friends</h2>

      <p>
        My cat <strong>Murko</strong>, was the best cat in the world. Ever since he was little he was always a curious cat. He always wanted to play and enjoy hanging out. He would listen to me about my thoughts and try to cheer me up when I was down. Coming in for cat hugs and just sleeping with me when we both tired. There would be times when we may forget to feed him but he knew he we were just trying to get him to eat less.

      <p>
        There would be times where he would meow, im sure it was cause he was lonely or he thought he was alone. Everytime he would do that, I would make sure he is not and let him know everything is okay. I feel like he would know when I would be having a bad day cause when I would get home he would come into my room, <em>yes even though he would go to sleep</em>, he made me feel not alone and eventually I would take a nap next to him.

        With him almost gone for almost 2 months and christmas coming around the corner, its going to be my first christmas without him. I feel pretty lost without him. He was my only friend that was by my side at almost all times. Its like when I need him most he is no longer with me. A lot of things had happen ever since he had died. Wished I could just restart my whole year. 2021 was just not my year nor his.

        I told him that I'd make him proud, I would finnesse my life and become the type of person I tried to become before this whole corona virus. Just feel like I have gotten lower than before and just need to get myself back up and going, at least for murchick. We had goals to move out together and be able to enjoy some years like cool kids. Staying up all night, eating and watching cool movies, playing some video games and creating cool designs and programs/apps/webpages. But now I just dont feel like continuing. Just feel so alone and lost. I miss this dude.
